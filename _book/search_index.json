In brief, when your data is tidy, each column is a variable and each row is an observation. Tidying data is important because the consistent structure lets you focus your struggle on questions about the data, not fighting to get the data into the right form for different functions. - Garrett Grolemund &amp; Hadley Wickham, R for Data Science Explore Raw Data {base} attr() attr(x, \"names\") is the same as base::names(x).

Dates and Datetimes {anytime} anytime(): Parse POSIXct or Date objects from input data. {base} as.Date() OlsonNames() Displays available time zones. as.POSIXct.*() as.POSIXlt.*() strptime() Date-time conversion to and from character. Sys.timezone() See also base::OlsonNames(). {fasttime} fastPOSIXct() Convert strings into POSIXct object (string must be in year, month, day, hour, minute, second format.) {hms} as.hms() hms() Store time-of-day values as hms class. is.hms() {lubridate} as_date() fast_strptime() Fast C parser of numeric formats only that accepts explicit format arguments (just as base::strptime()). Note that the format argument must match the input exactly, including any non-white space characters (such as T and Z). make_date() Create dates from numeric representations. make_datetime() Create date-times from numeric representations. parse_date_time() This function can be slow, because it is designed to be forgiving and flexible. If the dates you are working with are in a consistent format (ideally ISO 8601), use one of the following: fasttime::fastPOSIXct() or lubridate::parse_date_time2(). parse_date_time2() Fast C parser of numeric orders. ymd(): Parse dates with year, month, and day components. Related formats: ydm(), mdy(), myd(), dmy(), dym(), yq(). ymd_hms(): Parse date-times with year, month, day, hour, minute, and second components.

Operators: Arithmetic Operators: +, -, *, /, %% Comparison Operators: &lt;, &gt;, &lt;=, &gt;=, ==, !=. Use identical() and (all.equal)) rather than == and != in tests where a single TRUE or FALSE is required (such as if expressions). range() Use diff(range()) to get the range as a measure of variability. round() rowMeans() rowSums() scale() sd() signif() Round values to a specified number of significant digits. sqrt() sum() summary() var() {dplyr} count() group_by() n() Must be used within summarize(), mutate(), or filter(). n_distinct() near() Compare two numeric vectors (safer than using ==). summarize() Use mean(variable == value) to get a percentage (see the above example for mean().)

To change the case of a character variable, for example, do something like: Child function: transmute() (drops existing variables). recode(): Recode values (the numeric alternative to using if_else or case_when()). Example: dplyr::mutate df &lt;- df %&gt;% mutate(var_name = str_to_lower(var_name)) # Add a T/F vector, which can then be referenced to highlight certain # information in a plot: df &lt;- df %&gt;% mutate(hilight = attributed_provider_id = 95597) Dates and Datetimes base::date Get the current system date and time. base::difftime Time intervals and differences. base::difftime is the function behind the - operator when used with dates and datetimes (e.g., time_1 - time_2 is equivalent to difftime(time_1, time_2)). The advantage of using difftime over -, however, is the units argument because it allows you to specify the unit of time in which the difference is calculated. base::months Extract the month names. base::quarters Extract the calendar quarters. base::seq.Date base::Sys.Date Get the current date in the current time zone. base::Sys.time Get the absolute date-time value (which can be converted to various time zones and may return different days). base::weekdays Extract weekday names. lubridate::ceiling_date lubridate::date Get or set the date component of a date-time. lubridate::day Get or set the day component of a datetime. lubridate::floor_date lubridate::month Get or set the month component of a datetime. lubridate::now The current time (as a POSIXct object). lubridate::quarter Get or set the fiscal quarter or semester component of a datetime. lubridate::round_date Time spans: Duration Use when you are interested in seconds elapsed. lubridate::ddays lubridate::dhours lubridate::dminutes lubridate::dseconds lubridate::dweeks lubridate::dyears Time spans: Interval Use when you have a start and end. %--% int_aligns int_diff int_end int_flip int_length int_overlaps int_shift int_standardize int_start interval is.interval Time spans: Period Use when you are interested in human units. lubridate::day lubridate::hour lubridate::minute lubridate::month lubridate::second lubridate::week lubridate::year Time zones: lubridate::force_tz Change the time zone without changing the clock time. lubridate::tz Extract the time zone from a datetime. lubridate::with_tz View the same instant in a different time zone. lubridate::today lubridate::%m+% &amp; %m-% Add and subtract months to a date without exceeding the last day of the new month. lubridate::%within% Test whether a date or interval falls within an interval. lubridate::year Get or set the year component of a datetime. Factors forcats fct_drop(): Drop levels. fct_reorder(): Reorder levels, based on the value of another variable. fct_rev(): Reverse levels. stats reorder(): Reorder levels of a factor. Useful within the aes() argument in a ggplot() call. Merge or Append Data base append(): Add elements to a vector. cbind(): Combine objects by column. intersect(): Combine data shared in common between two datasets. Similar to dplyr::semi_join(). merge(): Merge two data frames. dplyr::join functions are an alternative to merge(). rbind(): Combine objects by row. setdiff(): Find the difference between two vectors. Similar to dplyr::anti_join(). union(): Combine two datasets without duplicating values. dplyr bind(): Bind multiple data frames by row and column. Child functions: bind_rows(), bind_cols(), combine(). Join Functions: Join two tables. Filtering Joins: anti_join(): Return all rows from x where there are not matching values in y, keeping just columns from x. semi_join(): Return all rows from x where there are matching values in y, keeping just columns from x. A semi join differs from an inner join because an inner join will return one row of x for each matching row of y, where a semi join will never duplicate rows of x. Mutating Joins: full_join(): Return all rows and all columns from both x and y. Where there are not matching values, returns NA for the one missing. inner_join(): Return all rows from x where there are matching values in y, and all columns from x and y. If there are multiple matches between x and y, all combination of the matches are returned. left_join(): Return all rows from x, and all columns from x and y. Rows in x with no match in y will have NA values in the new columns. If there are multiple matches between x and y, all combinations of the matches are returned. right_join(): Return all rows from y, and all columns from x and y. Rows in x with no match in y will have NA values in the new columns. If there are multiple matches between y and x, all combinations of the matches are returned. tibble add_column(): Add columns to a data frame. add_row(): Add rows to a data frame. Narrow in on Observations of Interest {base} order() See also: dplyr::arrange(). prop.table() Express table entries as proportions of the marginal table (thus, as the values are proportions of the whole, sum(prop.table(table_name)) = 1.) The input is a table produced by base::table(). Specify conditional proportions on rows or columns by using the margin argument. table(): Build a table of the counts at each combination of factor levels. Use base::prop.table() to see the table entries expressed as proportions. {dplyr} arrange() distinct() filter() When using multiple | conditions, use %in% to save space; see example below. rename() sample_n() select() Use ?dplyr::select_helpers to see the available helper functions. slice() transmute() A combination of dplyr::select() and dplyr::mutate(). Examples dplyr::filter() ilo_data %&gt;% filter(country %in% c(&quot;Sweden&quot;, &quot;Switzerland&quot;)) ilo_data %&gt;% filter(country == &quot;Sweden&quot; | country == &quot;Switzerland&quot;) Test {base} identical() See also dplyr::all_equal(), dplyr::near(). match() %in% is the more intuitive binary operator. setequal() Check two vectors for equality. See also dplyr::near(). which() This function is often unnecessary, according to Five Tips to Improve Your R Code. which.max() Use also to identify the first TRUE/FALSE. which.min() Use also to identify the first TRUE/FALSE. {dplyr} all_equal() Compare data frames. near() See also base::identical(). "],["visualize.html", "Visualize Interfaces Graphs, Charts, and Plots Graphs, Charts, and Plots - Statistics", " Visualize Visualisation is a fundamentally human activity. A good visualisation will show you things that you did not expect, or raise new questions about the data. A good visualisation might also hint that youre asking the wrong question, or you need to collect different data. Visualisations can surprise you, but dont scale particularly well because they require a human to interpret them. - Garrett Grolemund &amp; Hadley Wickham, R for Data Science Interfaces shiny Graphs, Charts, and Plots base::abline() Add straight lines to a plot. base::plot() base::points() Add points to a plot. diagram DiagrammeR GGally::ggally_box() GGally::ggpairs() Scatter plot matrix (SPLOM). GGally::ggparcoord() Parallel coordinate plots. ggbeeswarm::geom_beeswarm() ggplot2::aes() Arguments include color, fill, size, labels, alpha, shape (1-20 accept color attributes and 21-25 accept color and fill attributes), linewidth, linetype, and group. Use ?pch to see options for shape. Note that aes can be called within geom_* rather than prior to. The default shape for points does not have a fill attribute, which means that mapping a categorical variable onto fill wont result in multiple colors. Helper functions to include in the call when needing to modify the data include: stats::reorder(). ggplot2::coord_cartesian() Zoom a plot in or out without changing the underlying data. ggplot2::coord_flip() Flip the x and y axes. ggplot2::coord_polar() Use to convert a stacked bar chart to a pie chart. ggplot2::element_blank() ggplot2::element_line() ggplot2::element_rect() ggplot2::element_text() ggplot2::facet_grid() Lay out panels in a grid. ROWS ~ COLS: When using a tilde function, the variable on the left specifies the rows and the variable on the right specifies the columns. When faceting in only one direction (e.g., only on rows), use . to specify nothing for the unused direction. ggplot2::facet_wrap() Wrap a 1D ribbon of panels into 2D (observe a variable, conditional on another variable). ggplot2::geom_abline() Add reference lines to a plot. ggplot2::geom_bar() Create a bar chart, where the height of the bar is proportional to the number of cases in each group. ggplot2::geom_boxplot() ggplot2::geom_col() Create a bar chart, where the height of the bar represents values in the data. ggplot2::geom_density() Create a kernal density estimate (a smoothed version of a histogram). Consider using ggplot2::geom_rug() with ggplot2::geom_density() in order to be transparent about smoothed data. ggplot2::geom_dotplot() Create a histogram out of dots. ggplot2::geom_errorbar() Shortcut for geom_bar(stat = \"identity\"). ggplot2::geom_histogram() Use y = stat(density) to rescale the y-axis from counts to a probability estimate. ggplot2::geom_hline() *ggplot2::geom_jitter() Useful with ggplot2::geom_boxplot(). ggplot2::geom_path() Connect observations in the order in which they appear. ggplot2::geom_point() ggplot2::geom_rug() Useful with ggplot2::geom_density(). ggplot2::geom_smooth() Smoothed conditional means; aids the eye in seeing patterns in the presence of overplotting. ggplot2::geom_text() ggplot2::geom_tile() Heat maps. ggplot2::geom_violin() ggplot2::geom_vline() ggplot2::ggplot() ggplot2::ggtitle() ggplot2::group() Used within aes().

See Aesthetics: grouping for more information. ggplot2::labs() Modify axis, legend, and plot labels. ggplot2::position_identity() Dont adjust position. ggplot2::position_dodge() Dodge overlapping objects side-to-side. ggplot2::position_nudge() Nudge points a fixed distance. ggplot2::position_stack() Stack overlapping objects on top of each other, as counts. ggplot2::position_fill() Stack overlapping objects on top of each other, as densities. ggplot2::position_jitter() ggplot2::position_jitterdodge() ggplot2::scale_x_continuous() ggplot2::scale_y_*() ggplot2::scale_color_manual() ggplot2::scale_fill_*() ggplot2::scale_shape_*() ggplot2::scale_size() ggplot2::scale_linetype_*() ggplot2::stat_bin() ggplot2::stat_bin2d() ggplot2::stat_bindot() ggplot2::stat_binhex() ggplot2::stat_boxplot() ggplot2::stat_contour() ggplot2::stat_quantile() ggplot2::stat_smooth() ggplot2::stat_sum() ggplot2::theme() See example for grid::unit(). ggplot2::theme_get() ggplot2::theme_set() ggplot2::theme_update() When you call theme_update and assign it to an object (e.g., called old), that object stores the current default theme, and the arguments update the default theme. If you want to restore the previous default theme, you can get it back by using theme_update again. -DataCamp ggplot2::xlab() ggplot2::xlim() ggplot2::ylab() ggridges::geom_density_ridges() Create a ridgeline plot. graphics::boxplot() Create a box-and-whisker plot. graphics::hist() graphics::par() graphics::stripchart() One dimensional scatter plots.

DT::formatCurrency gt::gt Alternative to knitr::kable and DT::datatable, styled after ggplot2. kableExtra::kable_styling kableExtra::add_footnote knitr::kable lubridate::stamp Format dates and times based on human-friendly templates. scales::dollar Graphics ** knitr::include_graphics Embed external images in knitr documents. Preferable to the ![alt text or image title](path/to/image) Markdown syntax for embedding an external image, as include_graphics offers more control over the attributes of the image. Plots ggplot2::element_*: Specify the display of how non-data components of a plot are drawn. ggplot2::labs: Modify axis, legend, and plot labels. Child functions: xlab, ylab, ggtitle ggplot2::theme: Customize the non-data components of a plot. See example below. See ?theme_classic for a list of predefined themes. Example: ggplot2::theme ggplot(plot_data_2006) + geom_histogram(aes(x = working_hours)) + labs( x = &quot;Working hours per week&quot;, y = &quot;Number of countries&quot;) + theme( text = element_text(family = &quot;Bookman&quot;, color = &quot;gray25&quot;)) RMarkdown See RMarkdown: The Definitive Guide See Mozzila Developer Network for CSS help.

Programming is a cross-cutting tool that you use in every part of a project. You dont need to be an expert programmer to be a data scientist, but learning more about programming pays off because becoming a better programmer allows you to automate common tasks, and solve new problems with greater ease. - Garrett Grolemund &amp; Hadley Wickham, R for Data Science Characters References: * ?Quotes Conditionals &amp; Control Flows base Control (access documentation using ?Control) if (cond) expr The key difference between if (cond) expr and ifelse is that if (cond) expr will evaluate only the first element of an object with length &gt; 1. See the documentation for each function and the ateuchers GitHub example titled R: if vs ifelse to learn more. for (var in seq) expr while (cond) expr repeat expr break next identical(): Test objects for exact equality. Use identical() rather than == and != in if and while statements to test for equality. ifelse(): Conditional element selection. +dplyr::if_else()` is more strict by checking the object type. stop(): Stop execution of the expression and execute an error action. Useful in combination with an if statement when you want to generate helpful error messages. stopifnot(): Ensure the truth of an R expression. Prefer base::stop() to base::stopifnot(). dplyr case_when(): A general vectorized if. if_else(): Vectorized if. Environment and Workspace base::.libPaths() base::baseenve() The environment of the base package; its enclosing environment (parent environment) is the empty environment. base::dir() List the files in a directory. base::dir.create() Create a file path in the computers file system. base::emptyenv() The empty environment, which is the ancestor of all environments and the only environment without an enclosing environment. base::environment() The current environment. base::environmentName() base::exists() Remember that R will look for an object in parent environments until it reaches the empty environment, so use inherits = FALSE to limit the search to only the current environment. base::getOption() Set and examine global options. base::getwd() Get the working directory. base::globalenv() The environment in which you normally work, its enclosing environment is the last package attached with library() or require(). base::history() Display the previous 25 commands. base::install.packages() Install packages from repositories or local files. base::library() Load and attach packages, returning an error if the packages does not exist. base::list.files() List the files in a directory/folder. base::loadedNamespaces() Return the loaded name spaces. base::loadhistory() Recall command history. base::ls() List objects in the specified environment. base::list2env() From a list, build or add to an environment. base::new.env() Create a new environment. base::options() Set and examine global options. base::parent.env() Return the enclosing environment of the environment listed as an argument. base::parent.env() returns information that can be unhelpful, so use with base::environmentName(), as follows: parent.env(environment_name) %&gt;% environmentName(). base::q() Terminate an R session. base::R.version() Version information. base::R.version.string() Version information. Same call as R.version$version.string(). base::require() Load and attach packages, returning FALSE if the package does not exist. base::rm() Remove objects from a specified environment. base::savehistory() Save command history (default value is .Rhistory). base::save.image() Save the current workspace. base::search() Return a list of attached packages and R objects. base::searchpaths() Return the path to attached packages. base::setwd() Set the working directory file path. When using Windows, use / instead of \"\". base::Sys.getenv() See also Sys.setenv(). base::Sys.info() Extract system and user information. Example: Sys.info()[c(\"sysname\", \"release\")]. base::Sys.setenv() See also Sys.setenv(). gdata::object.size() Report the space allocated for an object. See also utils::object.size(). here::here() installr::updateR() Check for the latest R version; downloads and installs new R versions. pryr::where(): Find where a name is defined. utils::ls.str(): List objects and their structure. utils::object.size(): Report the space allocated for an object. See also gdata::object.size(). utils::sessionInfo(): Collect information about the current R session. References: Environments (Hadley Wickham, Advanced R) Evaluation (Standard and Non-standard) base cat(): Concatenate and print. print(): Print the argument to the Console. + A shortcut toprint()` is to place the code you want printed inside parentheses. quote(): Return the argument, unevaluated. writeLines(): Display quotes and backslashes as they would be read, rather than as R stores them (i.e., see the raw contents of the string, as the print() representation is not the same as the string itself). rlang Quosures enquo(), new_quosure(), quo(). References: Non-standard evaluation (Hadley Wickham, Advanced R) Non-standard evaluation (Hadley Wickham, lazyeval package vignette) Programming with dplyr (dplyr.tidyverse.org) Functionals {base} Apply Functions apply: Apply functions over array margins. lapply: Apply a function over a list or vector. sapply: Apply a function over a list or vector and return a vector or matrix. vapply: A safer version of sapply, as it requires the output type to be predetermined. mapply: Apply a function to multiple list or vector arguments. rapply: Recursively apply a function to a list. tapply: Apply a function over a ragged array. {purrr} map: Apply a function to each element of a vector. tidyr::unnest is useful in changing the list-column output of map into rows. map2: Map over multiple inputs simultaneously. map_if: Apply a function to elements of that match a condition. possibly: Usese a default value whenever an error occurs. quietly: Capture side effects in a list with components result, output, messages, and warnings. safely: Capture side effects in a list with components result and error. transpose: Transpose a list (turn a list-of-lists inside-out). Functions assertive::assert_*(): Check whether the input is * (e..g, assert_is_numeric()) and throw and error if the input does not meet the condition. assertive::coerce_to(): Coerce the input to a different class, with a warning. assertive::is_*(): Checks whether the input matches the condition specified by * (e.g., assertive::is_non_positive()). assertive::use_first(): Use only the first element of a vector. base::do.call(): Execute a function call from a name or a function and a list of arguments to be passed to the function. base::invisible(): Return a (temporarily) invisible copy of an object. base::match.arg(): Argument verification. Useful when matching a character argument specified in the function signature. For example, args(prop.test) ## function (x, n, p = NULL, alternative = c(&quot;two.sided&quot;, &quot;less&quot;, ## &quot;greater&quot;), conf.level = 0.95, correct = TRUE) ## NULL # The body of `prop.test` contains the following line of code: # `alternative &lt;- match.arg(alternative), which reassigns it to the selected # character vector. base::message() Generate a diagnostic message. Preferable to generating a message using cat. base::return() Return a value from a function. Useful in if statements where one condition is simple and the other is complex (see section 19.6.1 Explicit return statements in Hadley Wickhams R for Data Science. base::setNames() Set the names in an object. Useful in function writing; see documentation. base::stop() Stop execution of the expression and execute an error action. Useful in combination with an if statement when you want to generate helpful error messages. base::stopifnot() Ensure the truth of an R expression. See section 19.5.2 Checking values in Hadley Wickhams R for Data Science for a discussion of stop() versus stopifnot(). Consider functions from {assertive} as an alternative to stopifnot and stop. base::unlist() Flatten lists. Useful when using purrrs map functions, which return objects as type list. zeallot::%&lt;-%: Multiple assignment operator (see example below). Examples zeallot::%&lt;-%: session &lt;- function() { list( r_version = R.version.string, operating_system = Sys.info()[c(&quot;sysname&quot;, &quot;release&quot;)], loaded_pkgs = loadedNamespaces() ) } c(vrsn, os, pkgs) %&lt;-% session() Learn About an Object ?object_name ??object_name base::args(): Display the argument names and default values of a function. base::attributes(): View or assign an objects attributes (e.g., class(), dim(), dimnames(), names(), row.names()). base::body(): Get or set the body of a function. base::colnames(): Retrieve or set column names. base::dim(): Retrieve or set the dimnames of an object. base::dimnames(): Retrieve or set the dimension names of an object. base::formals(): Get or set the formal arguments of a function. base::help(): Get the topic documentation. base::help.search(): Search the help system for documentation matching a given character string. base::vignette(): View a specified package vignette. base::rownames(): Retrieve or set row names. Loops base::seq(): Sequence generation (this functions makes length() unnecessary). base::seq_along(): In for loops, safer than using base::ncol() or base::nrow(). Optimization microbenchmark::microbenchmark(): Sub-millisecond accurate timing of expression evaluations. + A more accurate replacement of system.time(replicate(1000, expr)).
