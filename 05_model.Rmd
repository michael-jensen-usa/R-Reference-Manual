# Model
***

"Models are complementary tools to visualisation. Once you have made your questions sufficiently precise, you can use a model to answer them. Models are a fundamentally mathematical or computational tool, so they generally scale well. ... But every model makes assumptions, and by its very nature a model cannot question its own assumptions. That means a model cannot fundamentally surprise you. 
- Garrett Grolemund & Hadley Wickham, *R for Data Science*"

## General

* `base::sample`
* `dplyr::sample_n`
* `stats::coef`
  * Extract model coefficients.
* `stats::cor`
* `stats::cov`
* `stats::cov2cor`
  * Scale a covariance matrix into a correlation matrix.
* `stats::var`

***
## Regression

* `broom::augment`
  * Augment data with information from an object.
* `broom::glance`
  * Construct a single row summary of a model, fit, or other object.
* `broom::tidy`
  * Turn an object into a tidy tibble.
* `{mgcv::gam`
  * Generalized additive models (GAMs) with integrated smoothness estimation.
* `mixtools::`
* `stats::df.residual`
  * Get the residual degrees of freedom.
* `stats::lm`
  * Fit linear models.
* `stats::p.adjust`
  * Adjust p-values for multiple comparisons.
* `stats::predict`
  * Model predictions.
* `stats::residuals`
  * Extract model residuals.
* `tidyr::nest`
  * Nest repeated values in a list-variable.
  * Helpful when separating a data frame in preparation to model the data for each grouping.

## Simulation & Prediction

* `base::set.seed`
* `stats::predict`
  * Model prediction.
  * Use with `lm` class objects and new data to predict new values (e.g., `predict(model, newdata)`).
* `stats::rnorm`
