# Model

"Models are complementary tools to visualisation. Once you have made your questions sufficiently precise, you can use a model to answer them. Models are a fundamentally mathematical or computational tool, so they generally scale well. ... But every model makes assumptions, and by its very nature a model cannot question its own assumptions. That means a model cannot fundamentally surprise you. 
- Garrett Grolemund & Hadley Wickham, *R for Data Science*"

## Cluster Analysis and Classification

`{cluster}`

* `pam()`
  * Useful for silhouette analysis; similar but not identical to `stats::kmeans()`.

`{stats}`

* `cutree()`
  * Pair with `stats::hclust()`.
* `dist()`
* `hclust()`
* `kmeans()`

`{randomForest}`

* `randomForest()`

`{rpart}`

* `rpart()`

`{rpart.plot}`

* `rpart.plot()`

## General

`{base}`

* `sample()`

`{dplyr}`

* `sample_n()`

`{stats}`

* `coef()`
  * Extract model coefficients.
* `cor()`
* `cov()`
* `cov2cor()`
  * Scale a covariance matrix into a correlation matrix.
* `var()`

## Regression & Machine Learning

`{broom}`

* `augment()`
  * Augment data with information from an object.
* `glance()`
  * Construct a single row summary of a model, fit, or other object.
* `tidy()`
  * Turn an object into a tidy tibble.

`{class}`

* `knn()`

`{mgcv}`

* `gam()`
  * Generalized additive models (GAMs) with integrated smoothness estimation.

`{mixtools}`


`{naivebayes}`

* `naive_bayes()`

`{pROC}`

* `auc()`
* `roc()`

`{stats}`

* `df.residual()`
  * Get the residual degrees of freedom.
* `lm()`
  * Fit linear models.
* `p.adjust()`
  * Adjust p-values for multiple comparisons.
* `prcomp()`
  * Principal Component Analysis.
* `predict()`
  * Model predictions.
* `residuals()`
  * Extract model residuals.
* `step()`
  * Step-wise regression.
  
`{tidyr}`

* `nest()`
  * Nest repeated values in a list-variable.
  * Helpful when separating a data frame in preparation to model the data for each grouping.

## Simulation & Prediction

`{base}`

* `set.seed()`

`{stats}`

* `predict()`
  * Model prediction.
  * Use with `lm` class objects and new data to predict new values (e.g., `predict(model, newdata)`).
* `rnorm()`
